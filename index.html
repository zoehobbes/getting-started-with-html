  <b>Lesson 1 Notes</b>

<br>
<br><b>• What is a web page?</b> 
<br>
A web page is a document written in HTML 
(Hypertext Markup Language). Web browsers read 
these documents, interprets, and then displays
them.

<br>
<br><b>• How coding works</b> 
<br> Programmers write text in a language (HTML) that 
computers can understand.

<br>
<br><b>• Computers are stupid</b>
<br> Programmers need to write with correct
syntax so computers can understand us.

<br>
<br><b>• Programmers can't remember everything</b>
<br> Programmers can use other resources and tools
to help with coding.

<br>
<br><b>• Some Basic HTML vocabulary</b>

<br><b> - Tag</b>: command or instruction.

<br>
<br><b> - Element</b>: everything within a set 
of an opening & closing tag. There are 2 types 
of elements: <b>inline</b> and <b>block</b>. 
Inline is simply text while a block element has 
an invisible box around the content.

<br> For example, "br" (break) is inline and 
"p" (paragraph) is a block element.

<br>
<br><b> - Attribute</b>: property of a element.
(For example, a link to a web page.)
